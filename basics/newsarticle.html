                    <h3>Image of Blackhole discovered<br> by a team lead by Katie Bouman</h3>
                    <h5>Katie Bouman is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard who helped develop the code to find the black hole needle in the haystack of data collected from the effort. This photo shows the first time she saw the results of that work, with the black hole image on her computer screen.

                    This is a photo of a pure “eureka!” moment. It’s delightful, an inspiration. It quickly went viral, and news outlets including the New York Times began hailing Bouman as the “face of the black hole project.”

                        Ezra had a point, and I filed the piece. And I think we might have been a bit too hard on ourselves as journalists. A lot of stuff is important, even quirks of Senate procedure, and there are many wonderful reporters, especially here at Vox, covering it.
